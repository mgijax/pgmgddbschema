#
#	  note that this view is selecting 
#         the 'mutant cell line strain' (cellLineStrain_key, cellLineStrain)
#         but not the 'parent cell line strain'
#	  because it is doing an outer-join to its parent cell line
#
#	  however, it seems that the outer-join can be removed
#	  because a mutant cell line will always have a
#	  parent cell line (the PCL can equal 'Not Specified')
#
#	  in which case, both parentCellLineStrain_key and 
#	  parentCellLineStrain can be added to this view.
#
#	  the EI Allele module uses this view to display
#	  its 'parent cell line strain', and is grabbing
#	  that info from the 'mutant cell line strain'.
