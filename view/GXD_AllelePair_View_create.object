# History
#
# 10/01/2012	lec
#	- TR10273/added _MutantCellLine_key_1/2
#
# 07/14/2011	lec
#	- convert to ansi outer join
#
# 08/20/2009 lec
#	- add out join to MRK_Marker._Marker_key
#
# 08/18/2009 lec
#       - TR7493/gene trap less filling
#	- remove union where _Marker_key is null
#	- short-term there will be no genotypes without markers added
#
# 11/20/2001 lec
#	- TR 2239/PhenoSlim; added alleleState
#
# union conditations:
# 1:allele 2 is not null
# 2:allele 2 is null
