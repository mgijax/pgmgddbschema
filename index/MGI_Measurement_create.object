# While my initial thought was to have a index on mgd.(_Statistic_key,
# timeRecorded), I will avoid that upon further reflection.  That ordering
# would force a great deal of row shuffling; new rows would most often need
# to be added to the middle of the table rather than at the end.  This would
# be a substantial performance drain.
