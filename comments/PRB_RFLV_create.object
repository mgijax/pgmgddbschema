COMMENT ON TABLE mgd.PRB_RFLV IS 'Defines a relationship between a Marker and an Endonuclease for a specific Probe Reference.  Variations exist between individuals in DNA fragment sizes cut by specific restriction enzymes; polymorphic sequences that result in RFLPs are used as markers on both physical maps and genetic linkage maps. RFLPs are usually caused by mutation at a cutting site.
