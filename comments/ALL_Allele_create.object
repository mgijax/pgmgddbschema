COMMENT ON TABLE mgd.ALL_Allele IS 'A record in this table represents one Allele.  An Allele is any of the alternative forms of a gene occupying a given locus; any one of several mutational forms of a gene. In MGI, allelic variants are associated with phenotypes. See ALL_Marker_Assoc.

A transgenic Allele will contain a Strain of Origin, and a new Strain can then be bred from this trangene.  This new Strain will be associated with the transgenic allele (see PRB_Strain, PRB_Strain_Marker).  For example, see TR11000/MMRRC/UC-Davis.  For example: MGI:4847055/Tg(Foxi2-EGFP)HX217Gsat, strain of origin: FVB/NTac.  New Strain: MGI:5003868/STOCK Tg(Foxi2-EGFP)HX217Gsat/Mmucd associated with MGI:5003868/Tg(Foxi2-EGFP)HX217Gsat via PRB_Strain/PRB_Strain_Marker.';
