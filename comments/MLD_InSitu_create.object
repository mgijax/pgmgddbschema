COMMENT ON TABLE mgd.MLD_InSitu IS 'Defines IN SITU Experiment.  In Situ Experiments use a DNA or RNA probe to detect the presence of the complementary DNA sequence in cloned bacterial or cultured eukaryotic cells.  This suggests the chromosome and band assignment of the marker to which the probe hybridizes.
