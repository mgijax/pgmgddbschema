COMMENT ON TABLE mgd.GXD_GelLane IS 'Defines a Gel Lane.  A Gel Assay is represented as a 2-D matrix with some number of columns (GXD_GelLane) and some number of rows (GXD_GelRow, GXD_GelBand).  Lanes have sequence numbers for ordering and labels to describe lane content.  The information associated with a Gel Lane corresponds to the way the gel was prepared in the lab.  Source material is derived from one or more tissues in an animal.  Tissues are described through reference to the anatomical dictionary.  Animals are described via their genotype, age and sex.  Minimal information is recorded for control lanes.

See GXD_Assay, GXD_Genotype, GXD_GelLaneStructure, GXD_GelRNAType.';
