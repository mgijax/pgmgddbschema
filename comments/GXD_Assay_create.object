COMMENT ON TABLE mgd.GXD_Assay IS 'A record in this table represents the high level definition of a Gene Expression experiment; the type of Assay, the Reference, the Marker of interest, the Probe used to detect the Marker or Reporter Gene, the Antibody used to detect the Marker or Reporter Gene, the Reporter Gene, and the Image Pane.  A Reporter Gene is a benign gene which is knocked-in to report the expression of the mouse gene. It is only applicable when Assay Type is "In situ reporter (knock in)", "In situ reporter (transgenic)" and "Recombinase reporter".  These three assay types may use a nucleotide probe (has a Probe Prep), an antibody (has an Antibody Prep) or direct detection (has neither a Probe Prep nor an Antibody prep).  Not all records in this table are in the GXD_Expression table.  Assay Type "In situ reporter (transgenic)" assays are excluded because they do not examine the expression of endogenous genes.  Assay Type "Recombinase reporter" assays are excluded because they do not examine gene expression.  See GXD_Specimen, GXD_GelLane.';
