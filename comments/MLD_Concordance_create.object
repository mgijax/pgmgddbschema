COMMENT ON TABLE mgd.MLD_Concordance IS 'Defines Concordance values for Hybrid Experiment.  The Concordance table contains results for either Markers or Chromosomes.  Concordance values are stored as integers which represent the number of Hybrid cells recording the presence/absence of a particular Marker/Chromosome in the Concordance table vs. the presence/absence of the Marker being tested for linkage: -/- (neither present), -/+ (linkage Marker present), +/- (Marker/Chromosome present), +/+ (both present).
