-- NAME: check_IMG_ImagePane_Assoc_delete()
--
-- DESCRIPTOIN:
--	
-- the template creates a trigger for all tables that use:
--	_Object_key
--	_MGIType_key
--
-- because these tables cannot use referencial integrity due
-- to the fact that their primary key is not necessarily the
-- member of the _Object_key/_MGIType_key table
--
-- . remove the statements that are not active for your table
-- . add the statements that are being active for your table
--
-- or you may keep all statements in the trigger even if your table
-- does not currently utilize them.
--
-- INPUT:
--	none
--
-- RETURNS:
--	NEW
--
